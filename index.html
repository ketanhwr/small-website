				I'm Ketan Gupta and I'm currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
				at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee also known as IIT Roorkee. I did my school
				 education from Delhi Public School, Ranipur.<br/><br/>
				I was born and brought at Haridwar, which is just 30 min away from Roorkee. My father 
				is a computer engineer at BHEL Ranipur and my mother is a teacher at DPS Ranipur. 
				I have a younger brother who is currently studying in class 9th.<br/><br/>
				I have deep interest in anything related to tech and I have a strong sense of responsibility 
				when it comes about handling huge amount of work. I have lead people many a times and have 
				been successful in most of them. Among my achievements, I have reached IOITC and got JEE rank 
				448. I am also a NTSE Scholar.<br/><br/>
				Apart from these, I play the violin, sing and watch TV series. I play badminton and table tennis 
				(I always like to challenge people for a game). Cheers!
